## TODO
- API: User/validateAccount return 200 but malformed
- API: deleteUser returns 403
- API: Prevent adding licences if order & sku already exists

- Feedback on adding same product in same order
- Get lmsuserid & licensinguserid if it's not already set in wp_user_meta()
- Clean skus and remove function to do so from partial/ml_license_management.php
- Will the user get an email with the new password after creating an lms account
- Might be better for user to add username/pass for create LMS rather than autocreate
